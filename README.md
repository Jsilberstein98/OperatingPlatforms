Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Answer: Game Room is working to develop a new web-based game that serves multiple platforms and draws heavily from their original game Draw it or Lose It, which is currently only available on the android market. Draw it or Lose it is a game loosely based off of the popular 80’s television game show Win, Lose, or Draw, where players work in teams to decipher what is being drawn. Similar to the game, this app will use drawings as its main point of interaction, but with the caveat that players will instead be observing images as they get rendered by a large library of stock drawings. The game is four rounds of one minute each. Drawings are rendered steadily and consistently until the 30 second mark, win which the images are completely rendered. Currently the staff involved are unaware of how to set up the environment. The company wants the ability for multiple teams to be involved, as well as each team to have multiple players assigned to it. The game will also require an index of in-use team names so no two teams overlap in name. Additionally, only one instance of in game memory can exist at any given time which is possible through the use of unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Answer: In developing this documentation, I specifically was very thorough in my research and understanding of the problem as well as potential solutions. I spent much time peering through and reading different resources about the different aspects of this project for game room, which I believe shows in the thouroughness of the documentation.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Answer: In terms of developing code, I found that identifying and defining specific details that were absolute neccesities to include was very important for the efficiency of the project as a whole. It allowed me to identify spots that needed to have more time taken to ensure the highest quality possible, and showed me spots in the program that maybe shouldn't take up much of my time.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Answer: I would probably have chosen my evaluation at the end of page four, for the sake of being able to provide more detail and structure to my reasoning for this evaluation. Ultimately, the result would still be the same, but with mroe justification and breakdown of the reasoning behind the evaluation.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Answer: As a gamer myself, I took this project as an extension of my own gaming preferences. Everything I outlined in the projects documentation would be something that I as a gamer would want and need to see in a functional game to be happy playing it. It is very important to consider the usedr's needs when designing because ultimately, they are who you are designing for. If they don't like it, you weren't succesful.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Answer: I approached designing the software from a standpoint of importance of task. WWhile all time I spend on the development of the software is important, there are certain items based on what the user is interested in that are important to ideally have perfected, or as close to it as can be. For that reason, higher emphasis on time management was placed on additional items not pertaining to the main tasks at hand, which is similar to an agile approach's sprint methodology. This is an extension of the philosophy I intend to inact in my programming as a whole.
